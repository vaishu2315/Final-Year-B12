Step 1: Initially, the MRI scan image is uploaded,then the feature extraction and segmentation is done. 
Step 2: The tumor will be visible in grey scale format and the segmented part of the tumor can be seen.
step 3: The system detects the location, size and shape of the tumor using the segmented image.
Step 4: It displays a message called "tumor detected" if the tumor is detected and shows "no tumor" when there is no tumor detected.  
Step 5: Then if the the tumor is detected the system will give some general treatment suggestions and post-operative recovery ideas.
