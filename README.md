Step1 : Firstly the MRI scan image is uploaded,then the segmentation and detection is done using the CNN algorithm. 
Step 2: The dataset is collected and it is used for traning and testing.
Step 3: The images from the Testing Dataset undergo feature extraction process to extract all the required features to analyze the image and to produce the appropriate result
Step 4: Then these data will be processed further for the feature selection and the system is trained using deep learning algorithm
Step 5: Once training is complete, the system is ready for authenticating the users.
